Prepare to die!
Prepare yourself!
Prepare for combat!
Prepare yourself for the end!
Soon the world shall be rid of you!
I will enjoy ripping you apart!
Today you shall be tested!
I shall bathe in your blood this day!
I will destroy you!
Defend yourself!
I will delight in your screams!
There is no escape!
I shall feast on your agony!
I am going to split you in half!
Flee now, and live another day!
Your head will make a fine trophy!
May you die well!
These are your final moments!
You are a fool to have come here!
Finding me was your final mistake!
If you are not yet scared, you soon will be!
You should be proud to die at my hands!
You will beg for death before I am finished!
This is your last day alive!
Now you will know the true meaning of suffering!
You will know only terror when I am through!
Your life is already over.  Be still, and embrace death!
You will know nothing but terror when I am through!
You have found death today!
Surrender now, and I will end this quickly!
Cower before me!
Have at you!
I will tear you in half!
You are nothing to me!
I am the last foe you shall ever face!
Speak your last words, ere I rip out your throat!
Your life belongs to me!
Give up now! Submit!
Kill yourself now, and spare me the trouble!
May you rot forever in the Underworld!
May the gods take pity on you!
May your gods have mercy on you!
Pray to your gods, while there is still time!
May you die with honor!
May you prove a worthy opponent!
And now you will die, like so many before you!
Beg for mercy now, and your death may be painless!
You still have time to escape.  Use it!
If we must fight, let us not tarry.  Prepare yourself!
Run away, fool.  This is not a fight you can win!
Fear not.  We must all die someday!
Will you simply stand there gawking, or shall we settle this?
Who dares invade my domain?
Will you grant me death?
You dare challenge me?
Will you fight me with honor, or die in disgrace?
Well?  What are you waiting for?
Are you ready to greet death?
Are you truly prepared for what awaits you?
You do not run?  Do you not know who I am?
Will you succeed where others have failed, or suffer the fate that has befallen so many?
Have you come here to die?
Why do you insist on fighting?
Do you really think you are a match for me?
Why have you come here?
Are you brave, or merely stupid?
Shall we?
Who are you?
And now, my dear, I fear it is your day to die.
Come now.  I do not have all day.
Make your move.
Defend yourself, but be warned, I will not restrain myself.
You should run now.
I will enjoy watching you die.
I know why you have come here.  Let us finish this.
And here now stands another tool of fate to fall again.
Surely you know as well as I that we are compelled by forces unknown.  Let us put on a good show for them.
And now, I must kill you.
Ah haha haha!
Hehe hehe!
Heh heh heh.
Heh heh heh!
Ha ha!
Ah ha!
Hah!
Hyah!
Die, fool!
Die, cretin!
Die, vermin!
Die, filth!
Die! Die!
Imma deck you in the schnoz!
I'm gonna break you like a kit-kat bar!
Feeling like snickers?
I'm afraid you are as weak as a little BABY!
